#monitorSwitch

A python script, licensed under the GPLv3 (see LICENSE for more information), that toggles monitor output.

I use this script in i3wm so that I can bind one keyboard shortcut to activate an external monitor and deactivate the laptop display, and then to deactivate the external monitor and activate the laptop display.
